                        <p class="lead">Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest district of Panem, the remains of what used be North America. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. When her sister is chosen by lottery, Katniss steps up to go in her place.(Scholastic Press, 2008)</p>

                        <p class="lead">Meet Gregor, a kid from New York City, who falls out of his laundry room into a fantastical subterranean world called the Underland. Accompanied by his toddler sister, Boots, he encounters giant talking creatures-- cockroaches, bats, spiders and rats--and an unusual society of humans. And theyâ€™re all expecting him...(Scholastic Press, 2003)</p>

                        <p class="lead"> Frank is the stepfather to Dennis and Dee and is the owner of Paddy's Pub. In Season 2, Frank finds out from his ex-wife that he is not the biological father of Dennis and Dee, however he is shown to be a father-figure to both of them throughout the series. Frank lives in an apartment with Charlie (who also might be son), has a tendency to pull out a gun on people, and set Dee on fire multiple times with the goal of making her famous. </p>

                        <img src="Mac.avif" alt="Mac" width="350" height="350">
                        <p class="lead">Mac is the childhood friend of Charlie and Dennis and works as the bouncer for Paddy's Pub. He's often shown to be the least corrupt and manipulative of the gang, however throughout the series he has slept with Dennis and Dee's mom, made his cousin's funeral about himself, and lied to his father's parole board to keep his father in jail. One of the funniest running jokes in the series is Mac's childhood dog Poppins, who is somehow still alive after being with Mac and his parents since he was a kid. In Season 7, Rob McElhenny, the actor who plays Mac, gained 60 lbs to add a new comedic direction for the character, which became an episode of Season 7, "How Mac Got Fat".  </p>

                        <p class="lead">Charlie is the childhood friend of Mac and Dennis, and works as the janitor of Paddy's Pub. While the show makes it seem that he's the most sane out of the group, Charlie's illitaracy and obsession over a coffee waitress makes him just as crazy as the rest of the gang. Another running gag involving Charlie is that he might be the son of Frank, though this has never been confirmed. Some of Charlie's other worst moments include kidnapping a journalist for writing a poor review of Paddy's Pub, beating up a mall Santa for sleeping with his mom, and has consumed some pretty nasty stuff, including cat food, wolf hair, sunblock, and pieces of credit cards. </p>
